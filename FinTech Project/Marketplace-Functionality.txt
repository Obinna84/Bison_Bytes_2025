Artists:
- Must Provide:
    * Existing splits documentation
        $ Allows us to evaluate how much equity they have avaliable for purchase
        $ Ex: If artists owns 80% of their song, total shares caps out at 80%, so if they're offering
          shares at 5% per, then total stock maxes out at 16
    * Payout access
        $ We need to be able to ensure the artist is providing all information on payouts they recieve
          from song
        $ We also need access to the artist bank account info to be able to recoup money after they've
          been payed out. (EX:(1) Spotify pays artist.(2) Money goes to their account.(3) We take the 
          percentage of shares they've sold.(4) We distribute shares to song investors at the percentage 
          of the share(s) they purchased)
